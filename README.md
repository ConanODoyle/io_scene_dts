# io_scene_dts

### Goals

* Implement import and export of all detail levels, nodes, objects, meshes, materials and sequences from/to DTS/DSQ files.
* Support all versions of the DTS file format from the one used in TGE 1.0 to the one used in the current version of T3D.
* Support the newest version of Blender (at the time of writing, 2.75b), unlike the original DTS plugin (2.49b).
